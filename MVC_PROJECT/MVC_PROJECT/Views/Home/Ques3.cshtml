<h2> Difference between validation summary and ValidationMessageFor and how to check if the controller model is valid or not.Explain AntiForgery Token attribute also.</h2>
<p>
    ValidationMessageFor is used to show the validation mesasge for the feild on which we have implemented the
    validations respectively.
    ValidationSummary is used to show the validation message at one location (mostly at the top of the form).
    <br />
    Model validation is checked at Form (Go on Driver on sidebar and tap on Driver Form).
</p>
<br />
<strong>Anti-Forgery Token</strong>
<br />
<p>
    The basic purpose of ValidateAntiForgeryToken attribute is to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
    A cross-site request forgery is an attack in which a harmful script element, malicious command, or code is sent from the browser of a trusted user.
